<h2>Madelynn Parks</h2>
<h2>Maddy</h2>
<p>I'm headed into the computer science degree.
    I love to do a bunch of different things but my top activities I like to do is play lacrosse, go skiing, and read.
    I'm single and preparing to go on a mission sometime this summer.
    I love how before the start of class we say a prayer and I love how many members there are. The high scool I went to didn't have a ton of members my age.
    I'm not to educated about web design so I'm ecited to learn more about it.
    I love the scripture in 1Nephi chapter 1:16, where he goes and asks to be a witness and the Lord shows what he showed to Lehi.
    I am from Midland Michigan.</p>
